Almost everyone wants to learn a new musical instrument and improve on their technical abilities. There are certain challenges that comes with this;

The difficulty to find what to to learn.
The search for a tutor and mentor
The ability to stay consistent.
This is why we created PIANLY to ease your learning of musical instruments.
PIANLY is a site for learning instruments! Tutors can create a profile and start swiping through for instrument they are experts in. If you want to learn an instrument, they can "like" their profile, and schedule a confortable time to learn that instrument.

Other features include: editing the instrument's profile, time schedule for learning , and a "ratings" button to see the rankings of tutors.
The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at Holberton School . We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
